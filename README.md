# OpenParks API has reached EoL
I am sorry to announce, but OpenParks API, OpenParks and GeoParks App are sunsetted permanently.
# Why?
I decided that this API is useless and hard to maintain.
# What now?
I deleted all of the data, pictures, and others. You are now not able to parse API.
# Anything else?
Yes, here is another things that happened:
- Developemnt of GeoParks RT, GeoParks Legacy, and GeoParks Android is stopped permanently.
- API is no longer accessible; though the page will still exist.
- Developers, if you want to parse info about national parks, try to find another API.
